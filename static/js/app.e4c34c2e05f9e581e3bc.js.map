Registering for a CottageClass Account</h2>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Our Service allows Parents to enroll their minor children (\"Students\") in\n        camps, preschools, homeschool cooperatives, nannyshares, after school\n        programs and other courses that are taught by Teachers and listed on our\n        platform (each, a \"Listing\"). All Users must register for a CottageClass\n        account (a \"CottageClass Account\") in order to access and use the Service.\n        During the registration process, you will be required to enter certain\n        information, including your full name and email address, and to create a\n        password. Each User is responsible for safeguarding the password associated\n        with his or her CottageClass Account and agrees not to disclose his or her\n        password to any third party. Unless expressly authorized by CottageClass,\n        you are not permitted to share your CottageClass Account with anyone or\n        allow others to access or use your CottageClass Account.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information when you\n        register for the Service (and when you submit a Teacher Application, if\n        applicable), and to update such information to keep it accurate, current\n        and complete.

Submitting Your Teacher Application and Updating Your Profile</h3>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Once you have successfully registered for a CottageClass Account, if you\n        would like to be listed as a Teacher in our network and in order for\n        Parents to enroll their Students in your Listings, you will be required to\n        complete the Teacher Application. The Service will guide you through the\n        Teacher Application process, which may require you to, among other things:\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (i) provide a photo of yourself and complete your biography, which will be\n        publicly available for viewing by other Users on the Service;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (ii) provide at least three (3) references (\"References\"), who you\n        authorize us to contact;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (iii) provide us with your date of birth and social security number;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (iv) enter your bank account's routing number, account number and other\n        related information to enable you to collect fees as set forth in Section\n        2C below; and\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (v) create your first Listing, as further described below.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We will do our best to respond to your Teacher Application promptly, and we\n        may request additional information from you to process your application. We\n        will confirm once your Teacher Application has been approved. Once we have\n        approved your Teacher Application, Parents may begin to enroll Students in\n        your Listings. Also, you will have access to the Teacher Dashboard, and you\n        may, among other things, create new Listings, manage existing Listings and\n        communicate with Parents.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        You acknowledge and agree that in order to be listed as a Teacher on the\n        Service, we may refer you to Checkr, or another third party service\n        provider of our choosing, to conduct your criminal background check (a\n        \"Background Check\"). We may approve or reject your Teacher Application, or\n        remove you and/or your Listings from the Service, for any reason in our\n        sole discretion, including if we are not able to verify your information\n        with your References or if issues arise in connection with the Background\n        Check.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The selections you make during the Teacher Application process will be\n        saved to your CottageClass Account on the \"Teacher Options\" page\n        (collectively, your \"Teacher Profile\").

Creating Listings</h3>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Once you have submitted your Teacher Application and we have listed you as\n        a Teacher on the Service, Parents may enroll their Students in your\n        Listings. The Service will guide you through the Listing creation process,\n        which may require you to specify, among other things:\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (i) the type of Listing (e.g., camp, preschool, homeschool cooperative,\n        nannyshare or after school program) and to provide a description of your\n        Listing;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (ii) the date on which the first individual class or session (\"Session\")\n        for your Listing will be held (the \"Start Date\"), the date on which the\n        last Session will be held, the frequency of Sessions and the start and end\n        times for Sessions;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (iii) certain requirements or parameters for your Listing, including\n        minimum and/or maximum Student age, maximum number of Students that can be\n        enrolled in your Listing, and the minimum number of Sessions any Student\n        must attend in order to enroll in the Listing;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (iv) the address where the Listing will be taught or held (the \"Location\");\n        and\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (v) the fees for your Listing (\"Course Fees\").\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        You acknowledge and agree that we may reject or remove a Listing for any\n        reason in our sole discretion, including in the event the Listing does not\n        comply with these Terms of Service, our Non-Discrimination Policy or our\n        then-current guidelines for Listings. As between you and CottageClass, you\n        are solely responsible for (a) developing the curriculum or program for\n        your Listing and for teaching each Session, (b) finding a Location for your\n        Listing and obtaining all necessary consents, waivers, releases and other\n        authorizations (collectively, \"Consents\") from the owner of such Location,\n        (c) obtaining and maintain any teaching licenses (if and to the extent\n        required under applicable law), and (d) ensuring that your Listings, your\n        performance of your obligations hereunder, your use of the Service and your\n        operation of the Listings comply with all applicable laws, rules and\n        regulations, including any licensing requirements applicable to\n        homeschools, homeschool cooperatives, camps, preschools, nannyshares or\n        after school programs.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        You may utilize one or more assistant(s) (each, an \"Assistant\") for your\n        Listings, provided that (I) all acts and omissions of your Assistants shall\n        be deemed to be your acts and omissions, for which you shall be\n        responsible; (II) you ensure that each of your Assistants contacts us so\n        that we may arrange for Checkr, or another third party service provider of\n        our choosing, to perform a Background Check; and (III) you (and not\n        CottageClass) are solely responsible for making all payments to your\n        Assistants.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <h3>C. Fees and Payment Terms; Stripe</h3>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Each time a Parent enrolls a Student in one of your Listings, the Service\n        will calculate the total Course Fees the Parent owes and will allow the\n        Parent to elect to pay the Course Fees in installments or in full prior to\n        the Start Date (or prior to the first Session which the Student will\n        attend, if such Student enrolls after the Start Date or is not scheduled to\n        attend the first Session). The total Course Fees and payment schedule for\n        each Student enrolled in your Listings will be communicated to you in the\n        confirmation email you receive for such Student's enrollment. You may also\n        review this information at any time on the Teacher Dashboard. All\n        determinations made by CottageClass regarding fees shall be final and\n        binding on Teachers and Parents.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        With respect to each payment of Course Fees we receive from a Parent for\n        one of your Listings: (i) within ten (10) business days after (a) the day\n        on which we receive such payment from such Parent or (b) the Start Date for\n        such Listing (or the date of the first Session which the Student attends,\n        if such Student enrolls after the Start Date or is not scheduled to attend\n        the first Session), whichever is later, we will transfer to you an amount\n        equal to a percentage of Net Collected Fees (as defined below); and (ii) in\n        consideration for providing the Service and an online marketplace that\n        connects you with Parents, we retain the remainder of Net Collected Fees.\n        Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that we may reduce\n        amounts owed to you in the event we are required to provide a refund to a\n        Parent for your failure to attend scheduled Session(s), in accordance with\n        Sections 2D and 3C below. All payments must be processed using the Service\n        and you may not accept any cash payments from Parents who enroll their\n        Students in your Listings, except with our prior written consent. As used\n        herein, \"Net Collected Fees\" means, with respect to one of your Listings in\n        which a Parent has enrolled a Student, any Course Fees actually paid by\n        such Parent to CottageClass, exclusive of any (a) applicable sales, use and\n        other taxes, (b) service fees owed to or retained by any third-party\n        collection service we engage to collect past due amounts from such Parent,\n        and (c) transaction fees (including any processing or other fees collected\n        by our third-party payment processor).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We are under no obligation to pay any fees to you unless we have received\n        payment from the applicable Parent. You acknowledge and agree that (i) your\n        right to receive payment hereunder is contingent upon payment to us by the\n        applicable Parent, and (ii) you shall pursue any and all legal remedies for\n        nonpayment only against the applicable Parent and not against CottageClass.\n        While we use efforts in our discretion to collect payment from Parents, we\n        cannot guarantee payment from Parents and we shall not be liable for any\n        nonpayment by Parents.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        CottageClass uses Stripe, a third-party payment platform, to process\n        Parents' credit and debit card transactions and make periodic payments to\n        your bank account. You expressly understand and agree that CottageClass\n        shall not be liable to you for our failure to collect fees from Parents\n        arising out of any failure of such third-party payment platform. The\n        services provided by Stripe are subject to the\n        <a href=\"https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal\">Stripe Connected Account Agreement</a>\n        , which includes the <a href=\"https://stripe.com/legal\">Stripe Terms of Service</a>\n        (collectively, the \"Stripe Services Agreement\"). By agreeing to these Terms\n        of Service or continuing to operate as a Teacher, you agree to be bound by\n        the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from\n        time to time. As a condition of CottageClass enabling payment processing\n        services through Stripe, you agree to provide CottageClass accurate and\n        complete information about you and your business, and you authorize\n        CottageClass to share it and transaction information related to your use of\n        the payment processing services provided by Stripe.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <h3>D. Refunds</h3>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        You are required to teach each Session for which at least one (1) Student\n        is scheduled to attend. If you are unable to teach any scheduled Session(s)\n        (e.g., due to illness or family emergency), (i) it is your responsibility\n        to work with Parents in good faith to reschedule any such Session(s), and\n        (ii) if you are unable to reschedule such Session(s), any affected\n        Parent(s) will be entitled to a pro rata refund for such Session(s). If a\n        Parent is entitled to a refund in accordance with the preceding clause (ii)\n        and Section 3C below, we will notify you and you will be required to return\n        to us such refunded amounts no later than five (5) days after receipt of\n        such notice.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <h3>E. Teacher Representations and Warranties</h3>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Each time you use or access the Service (including each time you create a\n        Listing), you represent and warrant to CottageClass that:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          You have provided, and will continue to provide, information that is\n          correct and current;\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          You have obtained all required Consents for each Location from the\n          owner of the Location;\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          You are duly licensed to teach your Listings (if and to the extent\n          required under applicable law);\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Your Listings, your performance of your obligations hereunder, your use\n          of the Service and your operation of the Listings will comply with all\n          applicable laws, rules and regulations, including any licensing\n          requirements applicable to homeschools, homeschool cooperatives, camps,\n          preschools, nannyshares or after school programs;\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          You have the authority to agree to these Terms of Service and have the\n          necessary rights to perform your obligations hereunder; and\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          You (and not a substitute) will teach each Session in which one or more\n          Student(s) are scheduled to attend (except as expressly permitted by\n          CottageClass or with unanimous approval from at least one Parent of\n          each Student scheduled to attend such Session), and you will not assign\n          or subcontract the performance of your obligations hereunder to any\n          third party.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        <h3>F. Insurance; Claims Procedure</h3>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        CottageClass has General Liability insurance that is provided by our A\n        rated insurance carrier (the \"Insurance Policy\"). If an incident resulting\n        in bodily injury or property damage has occurred or a claim relating to\n        such an incident has been bought against you, and such incident or claim is\n        not the result of your breach of these Terms of Service, subject to the\n        terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy, you will be permitted to make\n        a claim under the Insurance Policy not to exceed the policy limit of\n        $1,000,000 per claim or occurrence. For the avoidance of doubt, only\n        Listings on the Service (and not any of your activities outside our\n        platform) are covered by the Insurance Policy.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Without limiting the foregoing, to be eligible to file a claim under our\n        Insurance Policy, you must:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Complete and submit the General Liability Claim/Incident Form,\n          available upon request by emailing us at <a href=\"mailto:info@cottageclass.com\">info@cottageclass.com</a>; and\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Provide any other information or evidence that CottageClass or our\n          insurance carrier reasonably requests when you file the claim.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        You must submit your claim under the Insurance Policy to\n        claims@ibariskmanagement.com within 5 business days after you first receive\n        notice or become aware of the claim or incident. CottageClass provides this\n        information to our insurance carrier for review and processing of your\n        claim. CottageClass will respond within 10 business days following the\n        insurance carrier's review regarding your claim.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <h3>G. Commitment Not to Engage Outside the Service</h3>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        For so long as you maintain an active CottageClass Account and are listed\n        as a Teacher on the Service, you agree not to engage any Parent or Student\n        other than through the Service and the CottageClass platform. The\n        restrictions in this paragraph shall not apply to any Parent or Student\n        with whom you had an existing relationship before you created your\n        CottageClass Account.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <h2>3. Parents</h2>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <h3>A. Enrolling Your Students in Listings</h3>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As a Parent, you may browse, search for and enroll your Students in\n        Listings that have been posted by Teachers. Before enrolling your Student\n        in a Listing, you may also contact the Teacher who posted the Listing using\n        the functionality of the Service to learn more about the Listing. Each time\n        you submit an enrollment form for one or more Student(s) for a particular\n        Listing, selecting from the choices afforded on the Service, you may be\n        required to, among other things:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Respond to the specific queries asked by the Service in connection with\n          the selected Listing;\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Designate the Session(s) that each of your Student(s) will attend,\n          subject to any minimum enrollment requirements imposed by the Teacher\n          (as further described below); and\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Complete an emergency contact and liability release form (a \"Release\n          Form\") for each Student who you have not previously enrolled in a\n          Listing, which will require you to provide physician contact, allergy\n          and other similar information.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        Certain Listings may require you to enroll your Student in all of the\n        scheduled Sessions, while other Listings may specify that you must enroll\n        your Student in at least a minimum number of Sessions. The total Course\n        Fees that you will be required to pay (as further described in Section 3B\n        below) will be made available for you to review before you submit the\n        enrollment form for the Listing. In consideration for providing the Service\n        and an online marketplace that connects you with Teachers, we retain a\n        portion of the Course Fees for our own compensation and pay each Teacher\n        his or her portion of the Course Fees.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        You are solely responsible for ensuring that your Students arrive at each\n        scheduled Session prior to the start time specified in the Listing, and for\n        arranging for transportation of your Students to and from each Session.\n        Teachers are under no obligation to delay the start time or to extend\n        scheduled Sessions if one or more Students arrive late. All acts and\n        omissions of your Students shall be deemed to be your acts and omissions,\n        for which you shall be responsible.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <h3>B. Fees and Payment Terms</h3>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        You may always elect to pay the total Course Fees for a Listing upfront\n        prior to the Start Date. Some Listings will permit you to pay the Course\n        Fees over time in installments (and, in such cases, the first installment\n        will become due prior to the Start Date). With respect to each Listing in\n        which you have enrolled a Student, you agree to pay us all Course Fees in\n        the amount(s) and on or before the date(s) specified in your enrollment\n        confirmation for such Listing. Additionally, each time you make a payment\n        of Course Fees, you also agree to pay us a nominal transaction fee\n        calculated as a percentage of the Course Fees then due (\"Transaction Fee\").\n        If you enable automatic payments using the functionality of the Service,\n        you acknowledge and agree that each time a payment of Course Fees becomes\n        due, we or our third-party payment processor may automatically charge the\n        credit or debit card you provide to us (during the Listing enrollment\n        process or on your CottageClass Account page) an amount equal to (i) the\n        Course Fees that are then due, plus (ii) the applicable Transaction Fee.\n        You may review your scheduled payments for each enrollment and modify your\n        automatic payment settings at any time on the Parent Dashboard. All\n        determinations made by CottageClass regarding fees shall be final and\n        binding on Teachers and Parents.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        All fees payable hereunder (a) are exclusive of any applicable sales, use\n        and other taxes, and you agree to pay (or reimburse us, as the case may be)\n        any taxes due in connection with these Terms of Service, other than taxes\n        on our income or the Teacher's income, (b) are non-refundable (including\n        any amounts you pay in advance prior to the Start Date or completion of the\n        Listing), except as expressly provided in Section 3C below, and (c) shall\n        be made in U.S. Dollars. In addition to any other remedies available to us\n        hereunder, if you fail to pay any undisputed amounts within thirty (30)\n        days after payment is due, then you shall pay us a late payment charge\n        equal to 1.25% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if lower).\n        All payments must be processed using the Service and you may not make or\n        offer to make any cash payments to Teachers, Assistants or any other person\n        in connection with any Listing, except with our prior written consent.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We use Stripe, a third-party payment platform to process credit and debit\n        card transactions for your CottageClass Account. Stripe may require you to\n        agree to separate terms and conditions that apply to the processing of\n        payments hereunder. We may replace our third-party payment processing\n        service without notice to you. If you have any questions or concerns\n        relating to payments that occur through your use of the Service, you must\n        contact CottageClass and not Stripe.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <h3>C. Refunds</h3>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        If a Teacher fails to attend or cancels any Session(s) that your Student(s)\n        were scheduled to attend, we will refund you any prepaid Course Fees on a\n        pro rata basis, provided that (i) you made good faith attempts to work with\n        the Teacher to reschedule such Session(s), and (ii) we are able to recover\n        such prepaid amounts from the Teacher (if we transferred such amounts to\n        the Teacher prior to the scheduled Session). All Transaction Fees are\n        non-refundable (including, for clarity, any Transaction Fees assessed and\n        paid in connection with any prepaid Course Fees).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <h3>D.

My 4-year old has been attending Tambor this year, and he has such a fun time with Marixsa and the kids in the group. We do not speak or teach Spanish at home, but when he goes to Marixsa's, he easily slides into the routine of Spanish. Her home is set up in such a child-friendly way, she makes food for the kids, and she works diligently to plan music, art, and physical activities that are age appropriate. Marixsa is also extremely trustworthy and responsible - she takes this job seriously and is a mom of 3. It's so clear that she is meant to be in early childhood education! Her warmth and her demeanor and patience make for a wonderful teacher. All of these wonderful things at a very reasonable price make this little playgroup a gem!\"},{\"name\":\"Susannah\",\"lastInitial\":\"M\",\"text\":\"My daughter loved her time with Marixsa.

We recently relocated to Brooklyn after living in Cusco, Peru and we had been looking for a school that resembled my waldorf/montessori inspired preschool over there, that my son loved. And we found it with Marixsa! A nurturing, creative and child centered discovery space with outdoors time to play with the earth and the water and in Spanish!! Our dream came true this summer and my boys would wake up every morning excited to go to the Taino school (that is how we named it)! Marixsa brings together her soul and love for the ways she believes her own children should learn, her roots and her professional teaching knowledge in the perfect inspiring way.\"},{\"name\":\"Jessica\",\"lastInitial\":\"D\",\"text\":\"My son had the fortunate experience of taking part in Marixsa's Spanish summer camp the very first summer she opened her home. Each day was filled with playful learning that was responsive to each child's needs. They spent lots meaningful time outdoors, learning in constructive ways.

You will not be disappointed if you choose to send your child to her program.\"},{\"name\":\"Ourania\",\"lastInitial\":\"A\",\"text\":\"I experience Mrs. Marixsa with her own and other children every day for the last year. As a certified Waldorf teacher and a mother myself, it is such a pleasing experience to witness her professionalism and art inner devotion during the interaction with children. She is guiding the children firmly, always with respect and warmth. There is always a positive and secure atmosphere within the groups, where elder children (up to 10years) show smaller children what they have discovered (f.i.). She gives children the space to develop socially, emotionally and at the same time manages amazingly that children of different age groups can be harmoniously together and/or explore age appropriately on their own. I know, my daughter (4yrs.) loves Mrs. Marixsa and her classes.\"},{\"name\":\"Eisa\",\"lastInitial\":\"R\",\"text\":\"I am happy to recommend Marixsa Rodriguez and her home-based summer program. I am the Founder and Director of Camp Fort Greene and a former classroom teacher with a master's degree from Teachers College, Columbia University. I have known Marixsa for 8 years, as our sons have grown up together here in Brooklyn. I first met Marixsa at the Clinton Hill Library, where we attended Mommy and Me classes led by a local librarian. Back then we joined forces with another mom who also has a master's degree in education, and the three of us developed a co-op program for our toddlers to experience rich opportunities for social, emotional, and cognitive development. We wanted to prepare our little ones for big kid school, so we added in circle time and clean-up time, and we wanted to provide age-appropriate activities, so we built in one simple craft project, time for singing with simple instruments, a story, and free play. We found a location in Bedford Stuyvesant and enjoyed a fun year together. While this once a week co-op program was taking place, we continued to get together in each other's homes for play-dates. Marixsa always contributed fun, age-appropriate craft activities, music, and Spanish language and culture to our experiences. She is gifted in her ability to design and make clothes, bags, and decorative items for children and adults, and she makes great use of found materials; Marixsa brings this talent to her work with children, encouraging them to design and make beautiful objects that are often also useful. She understands the importance of gentle music in little ones' lives, and her ability to sing while playing with percussive instruments designed for young people encourages their own inner musicianship and develops counting skills. She is bi-lingual, so she does more than count to ten in Spanish with children. Marixsa feels very strongly that young people learning the language should be able to talk about their use of a magnifying glass or the way a bird spreads its wings in Spanish. While she recognizes the value of basic conversational language learning, she provides opportunities for children to really develop a stronger Spanish language proficiency across the curriculum in areas like science and math. A dedicated learner herself, Marixsa studied scholarly books on Waldorf and Montessori. Over the years, she has never lost the opportunity to take advantage of a learning moment while encouraging fun and creativity. For example, instead of hiring a clown or magician for her son's birthdays, Marixsa would work with him to come up with a theme, make decorations for their home, and prepare fun activities for the birthday boy and all his guests to share together. Marixsa has a terrific affinity for the natural world and has developed that love in her own New York City children. They garden, compost, and explore all the wild wonders in our urban habitat. In her light-filled, warm, welcoming home, you will find intentional and natural objects in place to encourage age-appropriate explorations. She is a bright, beautiful, kind person who cares deeply about children. I recommend her and her program with great enthusiasm.\"},{\"name\":\"Liz\",\"lastInitial\":\"H\",\"text\":\"Marixsa is an open hearted, loving, creative, mother and amazing with children!!! If I still lived in Brooklyn (We moved to Canada.) I would definately send my daughter to Marixsa's Camp. Two years ago, we formed a Daycare Co-op at Marixsa's home with six children and Marixsa generously provided her home and even though we hired a child care worker, Marixsa was always doing creative projects and volunteering her time with the children. Marixsa is fully bilingual and my daughter now speaks some Spanish. Marixsa's children are amazing and my daughter became close to Taina and the girls have a bond forever. I am super picky about who I leave my children with in terms of a loving safe space but Marixsa is one of the best! Marixsa would never punish a child or treat them in any way except love and respect. Any family would be lucky to know Marixsa and her family!\"}]},{\"id\":2,\"networks\":[\"flatbushfamilies\",\"demo\"],\"name\":\"Manisha\",\"lastInitial\":\"S\",\"pic\":\"avatar-ManishaS.png\",\"phone\":\"646-623-4802‬\",\"availability\":[\"3to7\",\"after7\",\"weekends\"],\"location\":{\"lat\":40.680316,\"lng\":-73.97478},\"job\":{\"title\":\"Co-founder\",\"employer\":\"CottageClass\"},\"activities\":[\"french\"],\"images\":[\"manisha-4.jpg\",\"manisha-6.jpg\",\"manisha-7.jpg\",\"manisha-1.jpg\",\"manisha-3.jpg\",\"manisha-5.jpg\"],\"backgroundCheck\":true,\"emergencyContacts\":[{\"name\":\"Giseli
