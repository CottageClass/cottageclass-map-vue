    <h1>CottageClass Terms of Service</h1>
</p>
<p>
    These Terms of Service ("Terms of Service") set out the terms on which
    CottageClass Inc. ("CottageClass", "we" or "us") will provide access to and
    use of our proprietary online platform for childhood education, which
    connects teachers, artists, childcare providers, local experts and other
    instructors (collectively, "Teachers") with custodial parents, guardians
    and other family members having custody of minor children (collectively,
    "Parents"), through our website found at <a href="https://cottageclass.com/">CottageClass.com</a> (the "Site")
    and/or our mobile application (the "App", and, together with the Site, the
    "Service").
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Please read these Terms of Service carefully as they contain important
        information regarding your legal obligations, remedies and rights,
        including various limitations and exclusions. By indicating acceptance
        of these Terms of Service or by otherwise registering for or using the
        Service, you hereby agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, and
        our Privacy Policy found at <a href="https://cottageclass.com/privacy">cottageclass.com/privacy</a> (the <em>"Privacy Policy"</em>) and Non-Discrimination Policy found at
        <a href="https://cottageclass.com/non-discrimination-policy">cottageclass.com/non-discrimination-policy</a> (the <em>"Non-Discrimination Policy"</em>), which are incorporated herein by reference</strong>
    .
    <strong>
        If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Service, our Privacy
        Policy or our Non-Discrimination Policy, you must not access or use the
        Service.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you access the "Parent Dashboard" or other Parent-designated areas of
    the Service, the terms "Parent" and "Parents" apply to you and to all other
    CottageClass Parents. Additionally, if you submit a Teacher Application (as
    defined below) or access the "Teacher Dashboard" or other
    Teacher-designated areas of the Service, the terms "Teacher" and "Teachers"
    refer to you and all other CottageClass Teachers. The terms "User" and
    "Users" refer collectively to all Teachers, Parents and other individuals
    who register for or otherwise use the Service (including you). For the
    avoidance of doubt: (i) the provisions of Section 2 hereof apply only with
    respect to Teachers; (ii) the provisions of Section 3 hereof apply only
    with respect to Parents; and (iii) the provisions of Sections 1 and 4
    through 18 shall apply to all Users (including all Teachers and Parents).
</p>
<p>
    The Service, the Site and the App are owned and operated by CottageClass.
    We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or
    delete portions of these Terms of Service at any time without further
    notice. If we do this, we will post the changes to these Terms of Service
    on this page, send you an email notifying you that Terms of Service have
    changed at the email address you provide when registering (or which you
    later update), and will indicate at the top of this page the date these
    terms were last revised. Your continued use of the Service after any such
    changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. It is your
    responsibility to regularly check the Site to determine if there have been
    changes to these Terms of Service and to review such changes.
</p>
<p>
    The Service is intended solely for persons who are 18 or older. Any access
    to or use of the Service by anyone under 18 is expressly prohibited. By
    accessing or using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are 18
    or older.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>1. Registering for a CottageClass Account</h2>
</p>
<p>
    Our Service allows Parents to enroll their minor children ("Students") in
    camps, preschools, homeschool cooperatives, nannyshares, after school
    programs and other courses that are taught by Teachers and listed on our
    platform (each, a "Listing"). All Users must register for a CottageClass
    account (a "CottageClass Account") in order to access and use the Service.
    During the registration process, you will be required to enter certain
    information, including your full name and email address, and to create a
    password. Each User is responsible for safeguarding the password associated
    with his or her CottageClass Account and agrees not to disclose his or her
    password to any third party. Unless expressly authorized by CottageClass,
    you are not permitted to share your CottageClass Account with anyone or
    allow others to access or use your CottageClass Account.
</p>
<p>
    You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information when you
    register for the Service (and when you submit a Teacher Application, if
    applicable), and to update such information to keep it accurate, current
    and complete. You may not have more than one active CottageClass Account
    and we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your CottageClass Account
    and your access to the Service if you create more than one account.
</p>
<p>
    Upon creation of your CottageClass Account, you will automatically have
    access to the Parent Dashboard, which enables you to search for and enroll
    your Student(s) in Listings that have been posted by Teachers, as further
    described in Section 3 below. If you would like to become a Teacher, you
    must complete and submit our application form (the "Teacher Application"),
    as further described in Section 2 below.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>2. Teachers</h2>
</p>
<p>
    <h3>A. Submitting Your Teacher Application and Updating Your Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>
    Once you have successfully registered for a CottageClass Account, if you
    would like to be listed as a Teacher in our network and in order for
    Parents to enroll their Students in your Listings, you will be required to
    complete the Teacher Application. The Service will guide you through the
    Teacher Application process, which may require you to, among other things:
</p>
<p>
    (i) provide a photo of yourself and complete your biography, which will be
    publicly available for viewing by other Users on the Service;
</p>
<p>
    (ii) provide at least three (3) references ("References"), who you
    authorize us to contact;
</p>
<p>
    (iii) provide us with your date of birth and social security number;
</p>
<p>
    (iv) enter your bank account's routing number, account number and other
    related information to enable you to collect fees as set forth in Section
    2C below; and
</p>
<p>
    (v) create your first Listing, as further described below.
</p>
<p>
    We will do our best to respond to your Teacher Application promptly, and we
    may request additional information from you to process your application. We
    will confirm once your Teacher Application has been approved. Once we have
    approved your Teacher Application, Parents may begin to enroll Students in
    your Listings. Also, you will have access to the Teacher Dashboard, and you
    may, among other things, create new Listings, manage existing Listings and
    communicate with Parents.
</p>
<p>
    You acknowledge and agree that in order to be listed as a Teacher on the
    Service, we may refer you to Checkr, or another third party service
    provider of our choosing, to conduct your criminal background check (a
    "Background Check"). We may approve or reject your Teacher Application, or
    remove you and/or your Listings from the Service, for any reason in our
    sole discretion, including if we are not able to verify your information
    with your References or if issues arise in connection with the Background
    Check.
</p>
<p>
    The selections you make during the Teacher Application process will be
    saved to your CottageClass Account on the "Teacher Options" page
    (collectively, your "Teacher Profile"). You may modify or update these
    settings (such as your biography or your contact information) by updating
    your Teacher Profile using the functionality of the Service.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>B. Creating Listings</h3>
</p>
<p>
    Once you have submitted your Teacher Application and we have listed you as
    a Teacher on the Service, Parents may enroll their Students in your
    Listings. The Service will guide you through the Listing creation process,
    which may require you to specify, among other things:
</p>
<p>
    (i) the type of Listing (e.g., camp, preschool, homeschool cooperative,
    nannyshare or after school program) and to provide a description of your
    Listing;
</p>
<p>
    (ii) the date on which the first individual class or session ("Session")
    for your Listing will be held (the "Start Date"), the date on which the
    last Session will be held, the frequency of Sessions and the start and end
    times for Sessions;
</p>
<p>
    (iii) certain requirements or parameters for your Listing, including
    minimum and/or maximum Student age, maximum number of Students that can be
    enrolled in your Listing, and the minimum number of Sessions any Student
    must attend in order to enroll in the Listing;
</p>
<p>
    (iv) the address where the Listing will be taught or held (the "Location");
    and
</p>
<p>
    (v) the fees for your Listing ("Course Fees").
</p>
<p>
    You acknowledge and agree that we may reject or remove a Listing for any
    reason in our sole discretion, including in the event the Listing does not
    comply with these Terms of Service, our Non-Discrimination Policy or our
    then-current guidelines for Listings. As between you and CottageClass, you
    are solely responsible for (a) developing the curriculum or program for
    your Listing and for teaching each Session, (b) finding a Location for your
    Listing and obtaining all necessary consents, waivers, releases and other
    authorizations (collectively, "Consents") from the owner of such Location,
    (c) obtaining and maintain any teaching licenses (if and to the extent
    required under applicable law), and (d) ensuring that your Listings, your
    performance of your obligations hereunder, your use of the Service and your
    operation of the Listings comply with all applicable laws, rules and
    regulations, including any licensing requirements applicable to
    homeschools, homeschool cooperatives, camps, preschools, nannyshares or
    after school programs.
</p>
<p>
    You may utilize one or more assistant(s) (each, an "Assistant") for your
    Listings, provided that (I) all acts and omissions of your Assistants shall
    be deemed to be your acts and omissions, for which you shall be
    responsible; (II) you ensure that each of your Assistants contacts us so
    that we may arrange for Checkr, or another third party service provider of
    our choosing, to perform a Background Check; and (III) you (and not
    CottageClass) are solely responsible for making all payments to your
    Assistants.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>C. Fees and Payment Terms; Stripe</h3>
</p>
<p>
    Each time a Parent enrolls a Student in one of your Listings, the Service
    will calculate the total Course Fees the Parent owes and will allow the
    Parent to elect to pay the Course Fees in installments or in full prior to
    the Start Date (or prior to the first Session which the Student will
    attend, if such Student enrolls after the Start Date or is not scheduled to
    attend the first Session). The total Course Fees and payment schedule for
    each Student enrolled in your Listings will be communicated to you in the
    confirmation email you receive for such Student's enrollment. You may also
    review this information at any time on the Teacher Dashboard. All
    determinations made by CottageClass regarding fees shall be final and
    binding on Teachers and Parents.
</p>
<p>
    With respect to each payment of Course Fees we receive from a Parent for
    one of your Listings: (i) within ten (10) business days after (a) the day
    on which we receive such payment from such Parent or (b) the Start Date for
    such Listing (or the date of the first Session which the Student attends,
    if such Student enrolls after the Start Date or is not scheduled to attend
    the first Session), whichever is later, we will transfer to you an amount
    equal to a percentage of Net Collected Fees (as defined below); and (ii) in
    consideration for providing the Service and an online marketplace that
    connects you with Parents, we retain the remainder of Net Collected Fees.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that we may reduce
    amounts owed to you in the event we are required to provide a refund to a
    Parent for your failure to attend scheduled Session(s), in accordance with
    Sections 2D and 3C below. All payments must be processed using the Service
    and you may not accept any cash payments from Parents who enroll their
    Students in your Listings, except with our prior written consent. As used
    herein, "Net Collected Fees" means, with respect to one of your Listings in
    which a Parent has enrolled a Student, any Course Fees actually paid by
    such Parent to CottageClass, exclusive of any (a) applicable sales, use and
    other taxes, (b) service fees owed to or retained by any third-party
    collection service we engage to collect past due amounts from such Parent,
    and (c) transaction fees (including any processing or other fees collected
    by our third-party payment processor).
</p>
<p>
    We are under no obligation to pay any fees to you unless we have received
    payment from the applicable Parent. You acknowledge and agree that (i) your
    right to receive payment hereunder is contingent upon payment to us by the
    applicable Parent, and (ii) you shall pursue any and all legal remedies for
    nonpayment only against the applicable Parent and not against CottageClass.
    While we use efforts in our discretion to collect payment from Parents, we
    cannot guarantee payment from Parents and we shall not be liable for any
    nonpayment by Parents.
</p>
<p>
    CottageClass uses Stripe, a third-party payment platform, to process
    Parents' credit and debit card transactions and make periodic payments to
    your bank account. You expressly understand and agree that CottageClass
    shall not be liable to you for our failure to collect fees from Parents
    arising out of any failure of such third-party payment platform. The
    services provided by Stripe are subject to the
    <a href="https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal">Stripe Connected Account Agreement</a>
, which includes the <a href="https://stripe.com/legal">Stripe Terms of Service</a>
    (collectively, the "Stripe Services Agreement"). By agreeing to these Terms
    of Service or continuing to operate as a Teacher, you agree to be bound by
    the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from
    time to time. As a condition of CottageClass enabling payment processing
    services through Stripe, you agree to provide CottageClass accurate and
    complete information about you and your business, and you authorize
    CottageClass to share it and transaction information related to your use of
    the payment processing services provided by Stripe.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>D. Refunds</h3>
</p>
<p>
    You are required to teach each Session for which at least one (1) Student
    is scheduled to attend. If you are unable to teach any scheduled Session(s)
    (e.g., due to illness or family emergency), (i) it is your responsibility
    to work with Parents in good faith to reschedule any such Session(s), and
    (ii) if you are unable to reschedule such Session(s), any affected
    Parent(s) will be entitled to a pro rata refund for such Session(s). If a
    Parent is entitled to a refund in accordance with the preceding clause (ii)
    and Section 3C below, we will notify you and you will be required to return
    to us such refunded amounts no later than five (5) days after receipt of
    such notice.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>E. Teacher Representations and Warranties</h3>
</p>
<p>
    Each time you use or access the Service (including each time you create a
    Listing), you represent and warrant to CottageClass that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You have provided, and will continue to provide, information that is
        correct and current;
    </li>
    <li>
        You have obtained all required Consents for each Location from the
        owner of the Location;
    </li>
    <li>
        You are duly licensed to teach your Listings (if and to the extent
        required under applicable law);
    </li>
    <li>
        Your Listings, your performance of your obligations hereunder, your use
        of the Service and your operation of the Listings will comply with all
        applicable laws, rules and regulations, including any licensing
        requirements applicable to homeschools, homeschool cooperatives, camps,
        preschools, nannyshares or after school programs;
    </li>
    <li>
        You have the authority to agree to these Terms of Service and have the
        necessary rights to perform your obligations hereunder; and
    </li>
    <li>
        You (and not a substitute) will teach each Session in which one or more
        Student(s) are scheduled to attend (except as expressly permitted by
        CottageClass or with unanimous approval from at least one Parent of
        each Student scheduled to attend such Session), and you will not assign
        or subcontract the performance of your obligations hereunder to any
        third party.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <h3>F. Insurance; Claims Procedure</h3>
</p>
<p>
    CottageClass has General Liability insurance that is provided by our A
    rated insurance carrier (the "Insurance Policy"). If an incident resulting
    in bodily injury or property damage has occurred or a claim relating to
    such an incident has been bought against you, and such incident or claim is
    not the result of your breach of these Terms of Service, subject to the
    terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy, you will be permitted to make
    a claim under the Insurance Policy not to exceed the policy limit of
    $1,000,000 per claim or occurrence. For the avoidance of doubt, only
    Listings on the Service (and not any of your activities outside our
    platform) are covered by the Insurance Policy.
</p>
<p>
    Without limiting the foregoing, to be eligible to file a claim under our
    Insurance Policy, you must:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Complete and submit the General Liability Claim/Incident Form,
available upon request by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@cottageclass.com">info@cottageclass.com</a>; and
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide any other information or evidence that CottageClass or our
        insurance carrier reasonably requests when you file the claim.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You must submit your claim under the Insurance Policy to
    claims@ibariskmanagement.com within 5 business days after you first receive
    notice or become aware of the claim or incident. CottageClass provides this
    information to our insurance carrier for review and processing of your
    claim. CottageClass will respond within 10 business days following the
    insurance carrier's review regarding your claim.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>G. Commitment Not to Engage Outside the Service</h3>
</p>
<p>
    For so long as you maintain an active CottageClass Account and are listed
    as a Teacher on the Service, you agree not to engage any Parent or Student
    other than through the Service and the CottageClass platform. The
    restrictions in this paragraph shall not apply to any Parent or Student
    with whom you had an existing relationship before you created your
    CottageClass Account.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>3. Parents</h2>
</p>
<p>
    <h3>A. Enrolling Your Students in Listings</h3>
</p>
<p>
    As a Parent, you may browse, search for and enroll your Students in
    Listings that have been posted by Teachers. Before enrolling your Student
    in a Listing, you may also contact the Teacher who posted the Listing using
    the functionality of the Service to learn more about the Listing. Each time
    you submit an enrollment form for one or more Student(s) for a particular
    Listing, selecting from the choices afforded on the Service, you may be
    required to, among other things:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Respond to the specific queries asked by the Service in connection with
        the selected Listing;
    </li>
    <li>
        Designate the Session(s) that each of your Student(s) will attend,
        subject to any minimum enrollment requirements imposed by the Teacher
        (as further described below); and
    </li>
    <li>
        Complete an emergency contact and liability release form (a "Release
        Form") for each Student who you have not previously enrolled in a
        Listing, which will require you to provide physician contact, allergy
        and other similar information.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Certain Listings may require you to enroll your Student in all of the
    scheduled Sessions, while other Listings may specify that you must enroll
    your Student in at least a minimum number of Sessions. The total Course
    Fees that you will be required to pay (as further described in Section 3B
    below) will be made available for you to review before you submit the
    enrollment form for the Listing. In consideration for providing the Service
    and an online marketplace that connects you with Teachers, we retain a
    portion of the Course Fees for our own compensation and pay each Teacher
    his or her portion of the Course Fees.
</p>
<p>
    You are solely responsible for ensuring that your Students arrive at each
    scheduled Session prior to the start time specified in the Listing, and for
    arranging for transportation of your Students to and from each Session.
    Teachers are under no obligation to delay the start time or to extend
    scheduled Sessions if one or more Students arrive late. All acts and
    omissions of your Students shall be deemed to be your acts and omissions,
    for which you shall be responsible.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>B. Fees and Payment Terms</h3>
</p>
<p>
    You may always elect to pay the total Course Fees for a Listing upfront
    prior to the Start Date. Some Listings will permit you to pay the Course
    Fees over time in installments (and, in such cases, the first installment
    will become due prior to the Start Date). With respect to each Listing in
    which you have enrolled a Student, you agree to pay us all Course Fees in
    the amount(s) and on or before the date(s) specified in your enrollment
    confirmation for such Listing. Additionally, each time you make a payment
    of Course Fees, you also agree to pay us a nominal transaction fee
    calculated as a percentage of the Course Fees then due ("Transaction Fee").
    If you enable automatic payments using the functionality of the Service,
    you acknowledge and agree that each time a payment of Course Fees becomes
    due, we or our third-party payment processor may automatically charge the
    credit or debit card you provide to us (during the Listing enrollment
    process or on your CottageClass Account page) an amount equal to (i) the
    Course Fees that are then due, plus (ii) the applicable Transaction Fee.
    You may review your scheduled payments for each enrollment and modify your
    automatic payment settings at any time on the Parent Dashboard. All
    determinations made by CottageClass regarding fees shall be final and
    binding on Teachers and Parents.
</p>
<p>
    All fees payable hereunder (a) are exclusive of any applicable sales, use
    and other taxes, and you agree to pay (or reimburse us, as the case may be)
    any taxes due in connection with these Terms of Service, other than taxes
    on our income or the Teacher's income, (b) are non-refundable (including
    any amounts you pay in advance prior to the Start Date or completion of the
    Listing), except as expressly provided in Section 3C below, and (c) shall
    be made in U.S. Dollars. In addition to any other remedies available to us
    hereunder, if you fail to pay any undisputed amounts within thirty (30)
    days after payment is due, then you shall pay us a late payment charge
    equal to 1.25% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if lower).
    All payments must be processed using the Service and you may not make or
    offer to make any cash payments to Teachers, Assistants or any other person
    in connection with any Listing, except with our prior written consent.
</p>
<p>
    We use Stripe, a third-party payment platform to process credit and debit
    card transactions for your CottageClass Account. Stripe may require you to
    agree to separate terms and conditions that apply to the processing of
    payments hereunder. We may replace our third-party payment processing
    service without notice to you. If you have any questions or concerns
    relating to payments that occur through your use of the Service, you must
    contact CottageClass and not Stripe.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>C. Refunds</h3>
</p>
<p>
    If a Teacher fails to attend or cancels any Session(s) that your Student(s)
    were scheduled to attend, we will refund you any prepaid Course Fees on a
    pro rata basis, provided that (i) you made good faith attempts to work with
    the Teacher to reschedule such Session(s), and (ii) we are able to recover
    such prepaid amounts from the Teacher (if we transferred such amounts to
    the Teacher prior to the scheduled Session). All Transaction Fees are
    non-refundable (including, for clarity, any Transaction Fees assessed and
    paid in connection with any prepaid Course Fees).
</p>
<p>
    <h3>D. Parent Representations and Warranties</h3>
</p>
<p>
    Each time you use or access the Service (including each time you enroll a
    Student in a Listing), you represent and warrant to CottageClass that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You have provided, and will continue to provide, information that is
        correct and current;
    </li>
    <li>
        Your performance of your obligations hereunder and your use of the
        Service will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations;
    </li>
    <li>
        You have the authority to agree to these Terms of Service and have the
        necessary rights to perform your obligations hereunder (and, respect to
        each Student who you have enrolled in a Listing, you represent and
        warrant that you have the legal decision-making authority to authorize
        such enrollment, to execute a Release Form for such Student and to
        provide any other consent required hereunder); and
    </li>
    <li>
        You will not subcontract or delegate the performance of your
        obligations hereunder to any third party.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <h3>E. Release of Liability</h3>
</p>
<p>
    TEACHERS ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND ARE NOT EMPLOYED BY COTTAGECLASS.
    ADDITIONALLY, THE LOCATIONS ARE OWNED AND OPERATED BY THIRD PARTIES THAT
    ARE NOT RELATED TO, ASSOCIATED WITH OR SPONSORED BY COTTAGECLASS. You will
    need to make your own independent judgment regarding your decision to
    enroll your Student in a Teacher's Listing at the specified Location. By

    or (b) if you are a Parent, your obligation to pay any unpaid amounts that
    become due for Listings in which you have enrolled a Student.

        such damages), including damages or loss of a "commercial" nature such
        as, but not limited to, loss of profits or revenue. It is expressly
        agreed that, except with respect to any fees owed to you by

        Service as a Parent) plus the total fees paid by CottageClass to you
        (to the extent you use the Service as a Teacher), during the
        twelve-month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to such
        damages.

    sale of substantially all of its assets to which these Terms of Service
    relate. Your registration, these Terms of Service and your rights and
    obligations hereunder are not assignable, or otherwise transferable or
