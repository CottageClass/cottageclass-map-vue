      <div class="question">I need a lot of childcare. How do I earn more points?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">There are two great ways to earn lots of points for childcare:</p>
      <ol class="ordered-list">
        <li class="ol-item"><strong>Invite lots of children attend your playdate. </strong>The best way to earn a lot of points all at once is to host a playdate and to invite a lot of friends to come! You can invite your own friends, kids in your child’s class and neighbors. Think of it like a very happy unbirthday party! You’ll earn 3 points per playdate per child. So, for example, if you have a really exciting Harry Potter pizza party and 15 kids come, you’ll earn 15 playdates for your own child (or 45 hours of childcare).</li>
        <li class="ol-item"><strong>Host lots of playdates. </strong>You can also earn points by hosting multiple playdates for a smaller number of children. So, for example, if you need childcare coverage every Wednesday night, you could consider offering childcare every Tuesday night. Or you can do some combination of the two strategies!</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="question">What if I’m the first person to join in my neighborhood?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">KidsClub is set up to support you in sharing childcare wherever you live! All you have to do is host a playdate, invite friends, classmates and/or people in your local parent groups. Once they RSVP to your playdate, they’ll be prompted to reciprocate by hosting playdates of their own and inviting their friends. Before you know it, you’ll have a thriving group of amazing parents sharing care!</p>
      <div class="question">What if I don’t have any points?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">Every parent starts out with points by offering to host their first playdate. If you run out of points, just schedule another playdate on the calendar! Everytime you RSVP for a playdate you’ll have the opportunity to schedule your own to pay for your childcare.</p>
      <div class="question">Can I join if I’m not a parent?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">No. KidsClub is a community to encourage parents to share childcare and educational activities with other parents to build community, save money and get access to the highest quality care. If you’re not a parent and would like to offer a paid or a free offering, we encourage you to visit our sister platform, <a href="https://www.cottageclass.com/teach">CottageClass</a> to share your offering!</p>

      <h2 class="heading-2">Hosting Playdates</h2>
      <div class="question">How do I invite my friends and child’s classmates to share childcare with me?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">KidsClub makes sharing care with friends easy! All you have to do is invite your friends to your playdate or to join KidsClub. When they RSVP to your event, they’ll get prompted to create a playdate of their own and invite you!</p>
      <div class="question">How do I get people to come to my playdate and earn points?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">Once you’ve scheduled your first playdate, you’ll be able to share the link to your playdate with your friends invite your friends to share childcare with you! To RSVP, they’ll be prompted to create their own playdate that you can send your child to attend and also invite their friends so your network for childcare will grow and grow! Other members of KidsClub will also have the option to RSVP to your playdate. We encourage you to invite as many friends as possible to grow the KidsClub community with incredible people and expand the options for free, quality care!</p>
      <div class="question">Can I offer more than one playdate a month?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">Absolutely! You can offer as many playdates as you like! We recommend offering the same amount of childcare that you need. For example, if you’re looking for coverage once a month, the once a month option is great. If you need childcare on a weekly basis, we recommend offering a playdate once a week.</p>

      <div class="question">Can I control who attends my playdate?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">You have the right to accept or decline any family that RSVP’s to your playdate. You will receive a notification if a family RSVP’s. If you do not reply within 24 hours, we will assume that the booking is confirmed.</p>
      <div class="question">Can I choose the ages of children who attend my playdate?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">You can definitely set a minimum and maximum age you feel comfortable with. We understand that parents often wish for their child to play with children the same age. However, we also encourage you to experiment with hosting much younger or much older children. You may be surprised with what fun your 5 year old will have being a big sister to a 2 year old - or how much she could learn by having an 8 year old “big brother” around for a few hours.</p>
      <div class="question">What should I offer on my playdate?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">Your playdate consists of a simple activity and serving a meal to the children who attend. Your playdate be very easygoing, for example, pizza and a movie. If you’re inspired, you are also welcome to design a more elaborate event, such as a painting party or a robotics workshop, but this is by no means expected or required.</p>
      <div class="question">What if no one RSVP’s to my playdate?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">By hosting your playdate, you automatically receive credit to attend someone else’s playdate even if no one books care. This is to ensure that all the families are covered for extra childcare, even if it&#x27;s at the last minute.</p>
      <div class="question">How long are playdates?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">Every playdate lasts at least 3 hours to ensure parents have enough time to drop their child off, head to whatever they’re doing and come pick their child up.</p>
      <div class="question">What if I need to cancel or reschedule my playdate?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">It’s fine to reschedule or cancel your playdate. We understand that being a parent puts you on a busy and sometimes messy schedule. If you do need to cancel or reschedule, please try to give us as much advance notice as possible, so that we can help your attendees booked in another playdate! We encourage you to contact us, rather than your guest so we can support them fully in finding alternate plans.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-2">Attending Playdates</h2>
      <div class="question">How do I book a playdate?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">You book your playdate by RSVP’ing to the events on the events page.<strong> </strong>When you book your playdate, you’ll get an automated text message from the KidsClub team confirming your reservation.</p>
      <div class="question">Can a family decline my RSVP?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">The family hosting the event has 24 hours to decline your request in case they can not accommodate you, otherwise you are good to go! We will do our best to find you another option should this occur.</p>
      <div class="question">What do I need to do before I arrive?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">Please be sure to fill out your registration form before the event so your host has your emergency contact information and knows about your child’s dietary preferences as well as any special needs. (You will only need to fill this out once).</p>
      <div class="question">What if I’m running late for drop-off?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">Part of the benefit of a parent-operated babysitting co-op is you don’t need to stress out about being on time! It’s good to arrive on time, but don’t worry if you’re a little behind. Parents understand that sometimes getting the coat and shoes on can take a little longer than planned. On the contrary, we strongly encourage you to be on-time or early for pick up.</p>
      <div class="question">What should I expect when we arrive?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">When you arrive, your host will likely have some games out or activities set up so your child can adjust easily. You are welcome to drop your child off at the door or stick around for a little while as your child gets adjusted, but try to be sensitive to your host’s preferences. Some hosts may enjoy having you hang around, while others might prefer you to take off on drop off. Plus, the purpose of this is for you to enjoy some well deserved time off! So take advantage of it!</p>
      <div class="question">Will my host serve dinner?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">After your child eases in with a few activities, they’ll be invited to dinner (around 30 minutes in). Your host will have prepared a meal that is in line with their dietary preferences based on information you provided in your registration form.. Please be sure to note any allergies in the form. If your child has severe food allergies or highly unusual preferences, you may want to consider packing a meal for them. (Feel free to reach out ot us if you have any questions about that)</p>
      <div class="question">What will the activity consist of?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">Following dinner, your child will be invited to participate in the planned activity (whether it be watching a movie, arts and crafts or other)</p>
      <div class="question">What if I’m late for pick-up?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">We strongly encourage you to plan well to make sure this doesn’t happen. Please be respectful of your host and be sure to arrive on time or a little early! However, if you are late, please let your host know as soon as you discover you are running late. You may also want to offer them a little gift of apology such as a free playdate or flowers or wine.</p>
      <div class="question">What if I need to cancel or reschedule my playdate?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">Just let us know and we’ll book you for something new!</p>

      <h2 class="heading-2">Community Rules</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">All members are required to abide by our <a href="https://www.cottageclass.com/terms-of-service#">Terms of Service</a>, however, here is a brief summary of some guidelines we’ve put in place to keep our community strong!</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Here are a few tips on having a great <strong>experience with Kids Club</strong>! In general, be kind, respectful and treat others as you’d wish to be treated!</p>
      <div class="question">When attending a playdate:</div>
      <ul class="unordered-list">
        <li class="ul-item">Don’t bring a sick child. If your child is feeling ill, we can certainly let you choose another date without losing any points! (The same goes for hosting. If your child isn’t feeling well, it’s fine to cancel! We can help your guests get rescheduled for another date)</li>
        <li class="ul-item">Make sure to RSVP every child who is attending. If you bring an extra child that you haven’t signed up, it can put your host in an awkward position.</li>
        <li class="ul-item">Pick your child up on time! You may even want to come a few minutes early. We know life happens and sometimes people are running a bit late, but do your best to be respectful of the parent’s time.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="question">When hosting a playdate:</div>
      <ul class="unordered-list">
        <li class="ul-item">As parents sign up for your activity, we’ll send you information about the children attending via email. Please be sure to check your email to see dietary preferences and any special needs of children attending and let us know if you need tips on how to accommodate.</li>
        <li class="ul-item">When families RSVP, you’ll receive a text notifying you. You can decline any guest within 24 hours—otherwise the booking will be confirmed. If you have any concerns about a guest, please let us know and we’ll work with you to find a solution.</li>
        <li class="ul-item">Only the host of the event can host. Please do not leave the children at any time with a person different than the profile of the person hosting the event. Likewise, you must be on the premises at all times during your activity.</li>
        <li class="ul-item">Before children arrive, we suggest put out a couple activities out like puzzles or board games or a few games to ease the transition and get your guest comfortable and involved in an activity right away.</li>
        <li class="ul-item">Try to have dinner ready around 30 mins after children arrive and start your movie or other activity shortly after.</li>
        <li class="ul-item">Consider inviting parents to stay for a few minutes while their child gets adjusted, but don’t be offended if they want to duck out quickly.</li>
        <li class="ul-item">Always err on the side of more communication. If there is some kind of accident or incident that is *not* a medical emergency, call the parent and calmly convey what happened.</li>
        <li class="ul-item">If there is a medical emergency, call 911 and then immediately call the child’s parent, followed by their emergency contact if necessary. You should receive an email with that information for each child.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="question">Respect and inclusion:</div>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Respect and inclusion</strong>: It is our mission to bring diverse communities closer together through supporting each other in this challenging and rewarding process of raising our children. Our <strong>Nondiscrimination Policy </strong>prohibits discrimination based on race, gender, national original, marital status or sexual orientation. If any user is found in violation of this Policy, KidsClub will take steps to enforce this Policy, which steps may include suspending or removing the user from the platform.</p>
