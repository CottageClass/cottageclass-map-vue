My 4-year old has been attending Tambor this year, and he has such a fun time with Marixsa and the kids in the group. We do not speak or teach Spanish at home, but when he goes to Marixsa's, he easily slides into the routine of Spanish. Her home is set up in such a child-friendly way, she makes food for the kids, and she works diligently to plan music, art, and physical activities that are age appropriate. Marixsa is also extremely trustworthy and responsible - she takes this job seriously and is a mom of 3. It's so clear that she is meant to be in early childhood education! Her warmth and her demeanor and patience make for a wonderful teacher. All of these wonderful things at a very reasonable price make this little playgroup a gem!"

We recently relocated to Brooklyn after living in Cusco, Peru and we had been looking for a school that resembled my waldorf/montessori inspired preschool over there, that my son loved. And we found it with Marixsa! A nurturing, creative and child centered discovery space with outdoors time to play with the earth and the water and in Spanish!! Our dream came true this summer and my boys would wake up every morning excited to go to the Taino school (that is how we named it)! Marixsa brings together her soul and love for the ways she believes her own children should learn, her roots and her professional teaching knowledge in the perfect inspiring way."

As a certified Waldorf teacher and a mother myself, it is such a pleasing experience to witness her professionalism and art inner devotion during the interaction with children. She is guiding the children firmly, always with respect and warmth. There is always a positive and secure atmosphere within the groups, where elder children (up to 10years) show smaller children what they have discovered (f.i.). She gives children the space to develop socially, emotionally and at the same time manages amazingly that children of different age groups can be harmoniously together and/or explore age appropriately on their own. I know, my daughter (4yrs.) loves Mrs. Marixsa and her classes."

    "text": "I am happy to recommend Marixsa Rodriguez and her home-based summer program. I am the Founder and Director of Camp Fort Greene and a former classroom teacher with a master's degree from Teachers College, Columbia University. I have known Marixsa for 8 years, as our sons have grown up together here in Brooklyn. I first met Marixsa at the Clinton Hill Library, where we attended Mommy and Me classes led by a local librarian. Back then we joined forces with another mom who also has a master's degree in education, and the three of us developed a co-op program for our toddlers to experience rich opportunities for social, emotional, and cognitive development. We wanted to prepare our little ones for big kid school, so we added in circle time and clean-up time, and we wanted to provide age-appropriate activities, so we built in one simple craft project, time for singing with simple instruments, a story, and free play. We found a location in Bedford Stuyvesant and enjoyed a fun year together. While this once a week co-op program was taking place, we continued to get together in each other's homes for play-dates. Marixsa always contributed fun, age-appropriate craft activities, music, and Spanish language and culture to our experiences. She is gifted in her ability to design and make clothes, bags, and decorative items for children and adults, and she makes great use of found materials; Marixsa brings this talent to her work with children, encouraging them to design and make beautiful objects that are often also useful. She understands the importance of gentle music in little ones' lives, and her ability to sing while playing with percussive instruments designed for young people encourages their own inner musicianship and develops counting skills. She is bi-lingual, so she does more than count to ten in Spanish with children. Marixsa feels very strongly that young people learning the language should be able to talk about their use of a magnifying glass or the way a bird spreads its wings in Spanish. While she recognizes the value of basic conversational language learning, she provides opportunities for children to really develop a stronger Spanish language proficiency across the curriculum in areas like science and math. A dedicated learner herself, Marixsa studied scholarly books on Waldorf and Montessori. Over the years, she has never lost the opportunity to take advantage of a learning moment while encouraging fun and creativity. For example, instead of hiring a clown or magician for her son's birthdays, Marixsa would work with him to come up with a theme, make decorations for their home, and prepare fun activities for the birthday boy and all his guests to share together. Marixsa has a terrific affinity for the natural world and has developed that love in her own New York City children. They garden, compost, and explore all the wild wonders in our urban habitat. In her light-filled, warm, welcoming home, you will find intentional and natural objects in place to encourage age-appropriate explorations. She is a bright, beautiful, kind person who cares deeply about children. I recommend her and her program with great enthusiasm."

I would definately send my daughter to Marixsa's Camp. Two years ago, we formed a Daycare Co-op at Marixsa's home with six children and Marixsa generously provided her home and even though we hired a child care worker, Marixsa was always doing creative projects and volunteering her time with the children. Marixsa is fully bilingual and my daughter now speaks some Spanish. Marixsa's children are amazing and my daughter became close to Taina and the girls have a bond forever. I am super picky about who I leave my children with in terms of a loving safe space but Marixsa is one of the best! Marixsa would never punish a child or treat them in any way except love and respect. Any family would be lucky to know Marixsa and her family!"
